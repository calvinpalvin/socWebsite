            <h2>What is Sociology?</h2>
            <p> The <a href="https://openstax.org/books/introduction-sociology-3e/pages/1-introduction" target=" ">textbook</a> from my introductory sociology class defines sociology as "the scientific and systematic study of groups and group interactions, societies and social interactions, from small and personal groups to very large groups." (Soc3e, section 1.1)</p>
            <p>Here are some important vocabulary words to get us on the same page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Society</li>
                    <ul><li>a group of people who live in a defined<br>geographical area who interact with one <br>another and who share a common culture</li></ul>
                <li>Culture</li>

                        <li>Culture is so much more than food, holidays and clothes. (thought they are a part of it!)<br>It also includes unspoken and unconscious rules.</li></ul>
