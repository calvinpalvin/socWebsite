            <h2>What is Sociology?</h2>
            <p> The <a href="https://openstax.org/books/introduction-sociology-3e/pages/1-introduction" target=" ">textbook</a> from my introductory sociology class defines sociology as "the scientific and systematic study of groups and group interactions, societies and social interactions, from small and personal groups to very large groups." (Soc3e, section 1.1)
            I like to think of sociology as the study of people and societies. We look at what has caused societies to be the way that they are, and how it impacts the people living in them. </p>

            <p>Here are some important vocabulary words to get us on the same page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Society</li>
                    <ul><li>a group of people who live in a defined geographical area who interact with one another and who share a common culture</li></ul>
                <li>Culture</li>
                    <ul><li>a group's shared practices, values and beilefs.</li>
                        <li>Culture is so much more than food, holidays and clothes. (thought they are a part of it!) It also includes unspoken and unconscious rules.</li></ul>
                <li>Social Institutions</li>
                    <ul><li>patterns of beliefs and behaviors that meet social needs and organize social life</li>
                        <li>Examples: Education, Family, Religion, Government</li></ul>
                <li>Micro-Level</li>
                    <ul><li>a small unit of analysis</li>
                        <li>Example: Sociologist studying individuals communication styles and how it shapes their relationships.</li></ul>
                <li>Meso-Level</li>
                    <ul><li>a medium unit of analysis</li>
                        <li>Example: Sociologist studying communication patterns in groups or organizations and how it influences group dynamics.</li></ul>
                <li>Macro-Level</li>
                    <ul><li>a large unit of analysis</li>
                        <li>Example: Sociologist studying how language evovles over time and how it effects cultural identity.</li></ul>
            </ul>

            <p>What do you consider <b>your</b> society? Would it be your city, state, and/or country?
            <br>What is <b>your</b> culture? What is an unspoken rule you would have to explain to someone who isn't apart of your culture? 
            <br>How did <b>your</b> schooling, and family life shape <b>you</b>? Who would <b>you</b> be now if you had gone to school in a different state?
            </p>
            
            <p>These are some questions to get you thinking about yourself, as a sociologist!
