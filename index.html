            <h2>Relationship between Sociology and Computer Science</h2>
            <p>While seemingly distinct, sociology and computer science intersect in various ways. The application of computer science in sociological research, known as computational sociology, utilizes computational methods to analyze social phenomena.</p>
            <p>For example, social network analysis and data mining techniques help sociologists examine large datasets to identify patterns and trends in social networks and behavior.</p>
