            <h2>How are Sociology and Computer Science Connected?</h2>
            <p> While they might seem completely different, or unrelated, sociology and computer science are more realted than you might think! 
                Sociology and computer science are both sciences, sociology is a social science, and computer science is a formal science. Other
                social science fields are: anthropology, economics, history and psychology. Other formal science fields are: mathematics, information
                theory and game theory.
                <br><br>
                A big part of both disciplines is <b>systems thinking.</b> Systems thinking means identifying what set of factors and or interactions
                are contriubting to certain outcomes. For example, in sociology, we could look at educational inequality within a state, which could be
                differing average GPA's, graduation rates, or funding by schools. Using systems thinking, we would look at how things like funding, extracurriculars,
                teachers, and curriculum effect students outcomes. We would also look at how students socioeconomic status, the local government, policies, and historical
                events effect student outcomes as well. We would then see how all of these different entities work together as a system, and understand why the inequality is
                happening. Then, we would make recomendations on how to change these entites so that all students have equitable outcomes in school.
                <br><br>
                But in computer science, we could use systems thinking for say making a new social media app. We would start with an idea, and then plan the app.
                Say we want to make a simple photo sharing app, where users can like, comment, and share each others posts. In our plan, we would have to understand
                how our code interacts with our teammates code, and how our code as a whole, databases, and servers interact with each other. While writing the code, 
                we have to keep in mind what its specific purpose is, and how different implementations would lead to different 'versions' of our app for users. 
                <br><br>
                Another thing that both computer sciencist and sociologist do is <b>data analysis</b>. 
                Computer scientist will gather data, usually in extremely large data sets. They will then analyze the data to uncover patterns, solve problems
                and make decisions or predictions based on their findings.  
                Sociologist gather their data through surveys, questionnaires, interviews, studies and more. They then interpret the data, and summarise their findings.
                They then present their data and findings through papers, talks, books, documentaries etc. They use what they have found to try to inact social change, or
                uncover patterns, establish correlations, or just to gain a deeper understanding of the people or society they are studying.
