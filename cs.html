            <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/css/ba" target=" ">UWT</a> defines Computer Science (& Systems) as "the science of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of both the hardware and software elements of computing systems."
            It's more than just coding! To me computer science is about learning how computers work, and how tools - such as coding languages, IDE's, the command line etc - work to effieciently use them to develop new or existing technologies. 
            In computer science, you have to understand how the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, but also how essential to the whole each part is.</p>

            <p>There was a lot of jargin up there for non CS people, so here are some important vocabulary words to get us on the same page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation</li>
                    <ul><li>the execution of a plan, design, idea, algorithm etc</li></ul>
                <li>Hardware</li>
                    <ul><li>the physical parts of a computer</li>
                    <li>Examples: Monitors, keyboards, hard drives, RAM etc</li></ul>
                <li>Software</li>
                    <ul><li>a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks</li>
                    <li>Examples: macOS, Microsoft Windows, PowerPoint, Chrome, Instagram etc</li></ul>
                <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</li>
                    <ul><li>software that helps deveolpers, programmers, students or anyone write code effieciently. </li></ul>
